# # The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

# # range(start, stop, step)
# for i in range():
#     print("Python")



# # syntax
# # for variable in iterable:
# #     # Code block to be executed


# mylist = ["One", 7 , True , "False", "javascript"]
# for i in mylist:
#     print(i)


# name = "Full Stake Development"
# for i in name:
#     print(i)



# While Loop in Python

# Syntax
# while condition:
#     # Code to be executed repeatedly
#     # Update loop control variable(s)



# count = 1
# while count <= 10:
#     print(count)
#     count +=1
    

# Control Flow Statement
# Break : The break statement in Python is used to exit or “break” out of a loop (either a for or while loop) prematurely, before the loop has iterated through all its items or reached its condition.



# Continue: 
# Python Continue statement is a loop control statement that forces to execute the next iteration of the loop while skipping the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration only


# for i in range(1,11):
#    if i % 2 == 0:
#     continue
#    print(i)

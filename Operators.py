# Operators
# Arithmatic Operators - Arithmetic Operators: Used for basic mathematical operations.

# print(10 + 10)
# print(10 - 5)
# print(2 * 3)
# print(10 / 3)
# print(10 // 3)
# print(10 % 3)
# print (2 ** 3)


# Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables, including compound assignments.
# num = 10
# num = num + 10
# #num += 10
# print(num)
# # num -= 5
# # num *= 2
# # print(num)
# # num %= 2
# # print(num)
# # num **= 2
# # print(num)


# Comparison (Relational) Operators: Used to compare values and return a Boolean result (True or False).
# print(9 != 10)
# print(9 <= 9)
# ==: Equal to
# !=: Not equal to
# >: Greater than
# <: Less than
# >=: Greater than or equal to
# <=: Less than or equal to


# Logical Operators: Used to combine conditional statements.
# # and  - Returns True if both statements are true.
# # or   - Returns True if at least one statement is true
# # not  - Reverses the result (e.g., not True becomes False).
# print (10 > 9 or 9 > 10)
# print(not(10 > 90))
# print(True or False)
# print (not False)



# Identity Operator
# is: Returns True if both variables are the same object.
# is not: Returns True if both variables are not the same object.
# mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
# anotherlist = [1,2,3,4,5]
# newlist = mylist

# print( mylist is not anotherlist)
# print(mylist is newlist)


# Membership Operators: Used to test if a value is present in a sequence (string, list, tuple, etc.).
# in: Returns True if the value is found in the sequence.
# not in: Returns True if the value is not found in the sequence.
# name = "Python"
# print("p" not in name)


# mylist = [1,2,3,4,5]
# print(3 in mylist)

# Bitwise Operator

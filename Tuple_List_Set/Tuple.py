#  1. Write a Python program to create a tuple with multiple elements.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# print(mytuple)


# 2.  Write a Python program to access an element from a tuple using index.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# a=list(mytuple)
# print(mytuple[4])


# 3. Write a Python program to access the last element of a tuple.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# a=list(mytuple)
# print(mytuple[-1])


# 4 . Write a Python program to slice a tuple to get the first three elements.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# a=list(mytuple)
# print(mytuple[0:3])


# 5 . Write a Python program to slice a tuple and reverse it.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# a=list(mytuple)
# print(mytuple[::-1])


# 6 . Write a Python program to find the length of a tuple.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# print(len(mytuple))


# 7 . Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# mytuple.count()
# print(mytuple)


# 8. Write a Python program to find the index of a given element in a tuple.

# mytuplet=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# print(mytuple.index("seven"))


# 9 . Write a Python program to concatenate two tuples.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# mytuple1=("one","two","three","four","five",6,7,8,9,10)
# a=list(mytuple)
# b=list(mytuple1)
# print(a+b)

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# mytuple1=("one","two","three","four","five",6,7,8,9,10)
# a=mytuple+mytuple1
# print(a)



# 10 . Write a Python program to convert a tuple into a list.

# mytuple=(1,2,3,4,5,"six","seven","eight","nine","ten")
# a=list(mytuple)
# print(mytuple)

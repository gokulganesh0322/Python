# 1. Write a Python program to access an element from a list using its index.

# mylist=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(mylist[4])

# 2. Write a Python program to access the last element of a list.

# mylist=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(mylist[-1])

# 3. Write a Python program to slice a list and get the first five elements.

# mylist=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(mylist[0:5])

# 4. Write a Python program to slice a list and reverse it.

# mylist=["one","two","three",1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# print(mylist[::-1])

# 5. Write a Python program to add an element to a list using append().

# mylist=["one","two","three",1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist.append("four")
# print(mylist)

# 6. Write a Python program to insert an element at a specific index using insert().

# mylist=["one","two","three",4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist[3]="four"
# print(mylist)

# 7.  Write a Python program to remove the last element from a list using pop().

# mylist=["one","two","three",4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist.pop()
# print(mylist)

# 8.  Write a Python program to remove a specific element from a list using remove().

# mylist=["one","two","three",4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist.remove(5)
# print(mylist)

# 9.  Write a Python program to clear all elements from a list using clear().

# mylist=["one","two","three",4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist.clear()
# print(mylist)

# 10.  Write a Python program to concatenate two lists into a single list.

# mylist=["one","two","three",4,5,6,7,8,9]
# mylist1=["ten","elevan","twelve",13,14,15,16,17,18,19]
# print(mylist+mylist1)
